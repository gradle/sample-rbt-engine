# Resource-Based Testing in JUnit 5

This project provides a sample [JUnit Test Engine](https://docs.junit.org/current/user-guide/#test-engines) that uses resource files to
define tests that can be run with JUnit 5.

This project contains an included build in `/sample-consumer`.

Run that project to demo using the plugin in a Gradle build with: `executeTests`.
